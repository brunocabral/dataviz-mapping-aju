# Interactive Data Visualization of Public Bus Transportation connections between bus stations in Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil.

The public bus transportation network has a great importance in the routine of the major part of the people of Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil. However, the mobility inside the network is cloudy for those whom has no knowledge about the bus lines' routes.

This project aimed to bring to surface some information insights about the flow of the current city bus network, hoping to clear some questions:
- For each bus line: which bus stations they visit?
- For each bus station: which bus lines visits there? Where can I reach from there? (What other stations?)
- Which bus stations are the most connected ones? Which ones are the less?
